About the project :
Abstract:
This project addresses the challenge of detecting deepfakes by designing and training a custom convolutional neural network (CNN). Traditional preprocessing methods like error-level analysis (ELA) showed limited success, prompting the development of a tailored CNN architecture. The model was trained on a balanced dataset of real and fake images, achieving higher accuracy and recall compared to ELA-based methods. This approach highlights the effectiveness of custom architectures in combating the growing issue of deepfake media and contributes to advancements in ensuring digital authenticity.

Key Features:

1. Custom CNN Design: Developed a lightweight architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, optimized for binary classification of deepfake images.
2. Performance: Achieved 63.72% accuracy and high recall, outperforming ELA-based approaches.
3. Dataset: Utilized the 140K Faces Dataset with data augmentation for robust training.
4. Efficiency: Demonstrated the capability to perform well on limited data and computational resources, making it suitable for practical applications.
